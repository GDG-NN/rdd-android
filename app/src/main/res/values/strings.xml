        This is a great time to network so don\’t forget to pick up your badges at Registration so others can clearly identify what your interests are.
        It\'s time to party with food, drink, music and fun. The evening will start with a band playing some smooth tunes to get the evening started, followed by STAND UP SHOW residents.
        You must show your delegate badge to be admitted to the RDD Social, so remember to wear it.
